I am now a master's student in [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.xjtu.edu.cn/) at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to have [Prof. Mingyu Gao](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~gaomy/) as my advisor. Before joining XJTU, I obtained a bachelor's degree from [School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence](http://cst.whut.edu.cn/), [WuHan University of Technology](https://www.whut.edu.cn/) in 2023. My research interests mainly lie in computer architecture, especially, the hardware acceleration, including homomorphic encryption algorithm and operator accelerator.
